            <h1>Hello, Iâ€™m <span>Alex</span></h1>
            <p>        My name is Alexis D. Desiatco. I was born to achieve my dreams and be happy. I am the youngest
                among of my brother and sister. I was born on February 9 , 2000 in Fariview, Quezon City.
                My name Alexis is a unisex name that can be use for either male or female. I usually like to 
                watch anime and movies because it is my way to escape reality and have some fun time for myself.
                <br>
                <br>
                I love having pets. I have 6 pets, 3 dogs and 3 cats I always care for them because they are my comfort and 
                happy pill that no one else can achive. I only have a small circle of friends because I'm a introvert that 
                can't handle a face to face conversation with other person because I'm having a social anxiety. I'm being 
                anxious for what people think about me.</p>
